# Chat-AI-UI Project Design Document

## Project Overview

Chat-AI-UI is a desktop application developed based on the Qt framework, aimed at providing users with an interactive interface with an AI assistant. The project includes several core modules, including user interface, network request management, and file processing functions.

## 3. System Architecture

- Adopts the MVC architecture pattern
- The data layer is responsible for file reading and type recognition
- The control layer handles user interaction logic
- The view layer is responsible for UI display

The project adopts the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and is divided into the following main modules:

1. **User Interface Module**: Responsible for displaying the user interface, including the main window, configuration dialogs, etc.
2. **Network Request Module**: Responsible for network communication with the AI assistant, handling HTTP requests and responses.
3. **File Processing Module**: Responsible for reading and writing local files.

## Module Division

### User Interface Module

- **MainWindow**: The main window, providing the main interface for user interaction with the AI assistant.
- **AIAssistantConfigDialog**: AI assistant configuration dialog, used to set the parameters of the AI assistant.
- **HttpConfigDialog**: HTTP configuration dialog, used to set the parameters of network requests.

### Network Request Module

- **HttpRequest**: The core class for handling HTTP requests and responses.

### File Processing Module

- **FileHandler**: Responsible for reading and writing local files.

## Interface Definitions

### User Interface Module Interfaces

- `void MainWindow::onSendButtonClicked()`: Handles the send button click event.
- `void AIAssistantConfigDialog::onSaveButtonClicked()`: Handles the save button click event.

### Network Request Module Interfaces

- `void HttpRequest::sendRequest(QString url)`: Sends an HTTP request.

### File Processing Module Interfaces

- `void FileHandler::readFile(QString filePath)`: Reads the file content.
- `void FileHandler::writeFile(QString filePath, QString content)`: Writes content to the file.

## 4. User Interaction Flow

1. The user starts the application
2. Selects the file to be processed
3. The system automatically recognizes the file type and displays the content
4. The user selects the text-to-speech function
5. The system outputs the speech result

- Improve the user interface design to enhance user experience.
- Optimize the network request module, adding error handling and retry mechanisms.
- Expand the file processing module to support more file formats.
